These files and folders contain the code for our ML models.

These models include:

- MelodyRNN - Generates simple melodies.
- PerformanceRNN - Akin to a reasonably good piano player messing around on the keys.
- ImprovRNN - Generates melodies under an underlying chord progression.
- Pianoroll RNN Nade - Interesting model.
- Polyphony RNN - Generates Bach-like music.
- Music VAE - Generates multi group melodies under chord progressions.
- Music Transformer - The **best** model of them al.
